## Technologies Used 🛠️

#### Backend
- **Languages**: Python
- **Frameworks**: Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Code Quality**: pycodestyle
#### Frontend
- **Libraries**: React
- **HTTP Client**: Axios
#### Authentication
- **Method**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
#### Additional Technologies
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Testing**: pytest

## Features
- **User Authentication and Authorization**: Secure login and registration for both clients and artisans using JWT.
- **Artisan and Client Profiles**: Detailed profiles for artisans and clients, including personal information and service details, with the ability to update them.
- **Booking System**: Clients can book artisans for services, with real-time updates and notifications.
- **Real-Time Email Notifications**: Automated email notifications for bookings, cancellations, and updates.
- **Direct Communication**: In-app messaging system for clients and artisans to communicate directly.
- **Booking Feature**: Clients and artisans can manage and view their bookings. Clients can book services and track the status of their bookings, including pending, confirmed, rejected, and completed. Artisans can update the status of bookings.
- **Search and Filter Feature**: Clients can search for artisans based on distance and filter them by specialization.
- **Report Feature**: Allow clients to report artisans.
- **Map or List View**: Clients can view artisans and their information on a map or in a list format.

## Challenges 🚧

- **Authentication**: Implementing JWT for stateless authentication presented challenges, especially with newer versions that had issues related to verifying the `sub` claim.
- **Scalability**: Ensuring the application could handle an increasing number of users and bookings required adhering to best practices for database design.
- **Performance**: To enhance performance, we optimized queries and database interactions, avoided the use of database listeners, and kept future growth in mind.
- **Security**: Protecting user data and ensuring secure transactions was a top priority.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrating various third-party services and APIs required cross-platform compatibility and the use of CORS.
- **Non-Technical Challenges**: Coordinating meetings and communication was difficult due to the team's diverse cultures, languages, and time zones. Additionally, the limited time available posed a significant challenge.


## Future Enhancements 🚀

- **Rating and Review System**: Allow clients to rate and review artisans.
- **Payment Integration**: Integrate payment gateways for secure online transactions.
- **Calendar Integration**: Sync bookings with popular calendar applications like Google Calendar and Outlook.
- **System Support**: Improve the Reporting feature and provide an advance customer support to assist users with any issues or inquiries.
- **Multilingual Support**: Add support for multiple languages to cater to a broader audience.
- **AI Recommendations**: Use machine learning to recommend artisans to clients based on their preferences and booking history.
- **Mobile Application**: Develop a mobile app for both Android and iOS platforms.
